Sequential clock pins without clock waveform

The following sequential clock pins have no clock waveform driving them.  No    
timing constraints will be derived for paths leading to or from these pins.

Loop-breaking cells for combinational feedback

The design contains loop-breaking cells that were inserted automatically to     
eliminate combinational feedback.  Since timing paths have been arbitrarily     
broken, timing results for this design should not be trusted.  The              
loop-breaking cells are:

Outputs without clocked external delays

The following primary outputs have no clocked external delays.  As a result the 
timing paths leading to the ports have no timing constraints derived from clock 
waveforms.  The'external_delay' command is used to create new external delays.

Scan mapping status report
==========================
    Scan mapping: converting flip-flops that pass TDRC.
    Scan mapping: bypassed.  You have to either 1) set attribute 'dft_scan_map_mode' to 'tdrc_pass' and run 'check_dft_rules' or 2) set attribute 'dft_scan_map_mode' to 'force_all'.

    Scan mapping bypassed because no TDRC data is available: either command 'check_dft_rules' has not been run or TDRC data has been subsequently invalidated.
