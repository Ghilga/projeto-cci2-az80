  11 Warning CDFG2G-622  Signal or variable has multiple drivers.           
                         This may cause simulation mismatches between the   
                         original and synthesized designs.                  
   2   Info  CG-103      Created discrete clock-gating module.              
                         Two discrete clock-gating modules are created:     
                         one for the positive-edge triggered registers and  
                         one for the negative-edge triggered registers.     
                         The names of the clock-gating modules are based    
                         on the name of the design.
