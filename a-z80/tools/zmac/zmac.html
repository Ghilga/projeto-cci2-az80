<H3>Overview of zmac</H3>
zmac is a Z-80 macro cross-assembler. It has all the features you'd
expect. It assembles the specified input file (with a '.z' extension
if there is no pre-existing extension and the file as given doesn't
exist) and produces program output in many <A HREF="#format">different formats</A>.
It also produces a nicely-formatted
listing of the machine code and cycle counts alongside the source
in a ".lst" file.
<P>
To reduce clutter and command line options, all zmac output is put
into an (auto-created) <TT>zout</TT> subdirectory.  For <TT>file.z</TT> the listing
will be in <TT>zout/file.lst</TT>, the TRS-80 executable format in <TT>zout/file.cmd</TT>
and so on.
<P>
<A HREF="#undoc">Undocumented</A> Z-80 instructions are supported as well as 8080 code.
<P>
zmac strives to be a powerful assembler with expressions familiar to C
programmers while providing good backward compatibility with original
assemblers such as Edtasm, MRAS and Macro-80.

<H3>Input Format</H3>
<P>
zmac uses the standard Zilog mnemonics, and the pseudo-ops are also
largely as you'd expect.
<P>
A "<TT>.</TT>" may optionally preceeed any psuedo-op.
For example, "<TT>.org</TT>" and "<TT>org</TT>" are treated as equivalent.
<P>
Input can be upper or lowercase.
<P>
Comments start with <TT>;</TT> and carry on to the end of the line.
<P>
Number constants can take a trailing h or a leading $ or 0x for hex,
a trailing b for binary, a trailing o or q for octal, or a trailing
d for decimal.
<P>
<TT>'LH'</TT> (any length 2 string) can be treated as a number whose value
is <TT>'H'</TT> * 256 + <TT>'L'</TT>.
<P>
Labels are declared with <TT>label:</TT> or just <TT>label</TT> - indentation is unimportant.
Labels can be up to 40 chars long.  They can start with and contain 
letters, digits, <TT>$</TT>, <TT>.</TT>, <TT>?</TT>, <TT>@</TT> and _.  Ambiguous identifiers like
<TT>$FCB</TT> will be treated as hex constants unless defined as a label.  Labels
declared with two colons (<TT>label::</TT>) make the label public.
<P>
Here is how other things work.  Numbers are used as examples, but a full
<A HREF="#expr">expression</A> can be used in their place.
<P>
<H4>Data</H4>
<P>
<TT>defb 42</TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A byte.  <TT>ascii</TT>, <TT>byte</TT>, <TT>db</TT>, <TT>defm</TT> and <TT>text</TT> are synonyms.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<TT>defb 'foobar'</TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>An ASCII character string (not NUL-terminated).
Double quotes can also be used.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<TT>defb 'Who needs anything more than CP/M?',13,10,'$'</TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Strings and bytes can mix together.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<TT>defw 2112</TT>

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<TT>defd $12345678</TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A double word (32 bits). <TT>dword</TT> is a synonym.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<TT>defs 500</TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Skip output ahead 500 bytes.  This will insert 500 zeros in the ".ams"
and ".cim" output files or if inside a ".phase" section.
<TT>block</TT>, <TT>ds</TT> and <TT>rmem</TT> are synonyms.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<TT>dc 'string'</TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Like <TT>ascii</TT> but accepts only a single string and the high bit of the
last character will be set.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<TT>dc count,value</TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Repeat the byte <TT>value</TT> a total of <TT>count</TT> times.  Similar to <TT>defs</TT>
except that memory is always filled with <TT>value</TT>.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<TT>incbin file</TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Inserts the raw contents of the file into the assembly.  Simpler for
large amounts of data.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<H4>Symbols</H4>
<P>
<TT>label equ 100</TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Define a symbol to have a fixed value.  The symbol can be used before it
is defined.  A symbol defined with <TT>equ</TT> or as a label can be defined only
once, except that a symbol defined with <TT>equ</TT> may be redefined to the
same value.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<TT>label defl 200</TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Define a symbol to have a changeable value.  The symbol cannot be used
before it is defined, and it can be redefined to a different value later
with another <TT>defl</TT>. <TT>aset</TT> is a synonym.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<TT>min</TT>
<P>
<TT>max</TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Same as <TT>defl</TT> except that the symbol is defined as the
smaller or bigger of two comma-separated expressions.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<TT>*mod</TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Increment the internal module name string.  The first time this results
in "a".  Then "b", "c", ... "z".  Then "aa", "ab", "ac", etc. all the way
up to "zzzz".  The module name string is used in <TT>--mras</TT> mode where "?" in
label names is replaced with the current module name.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<TT>extern lab1,lab2,...</TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The listed labels are defined in an external module for later linking.
No effect unless zmac is producing ".rel" output.
<TT>ext</TT> and <TT>extrn</TT> are synonyms.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<TT>public lab1,lab2,...</TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The given labels will be visible to external modules when linking.

<BLOCKQUOTE>Set the address to assemble to 0x9000.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<TT>phase address</TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Continue to produce code and data for loading at the current address
but assemble instructions and define labels as if they originated at
the given address.  Useful when producing code that will be copied to
a different location before being executed (e.g., an overlay).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<TT>dephase</TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>End <TT>phase</TT> mode assembly.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

No effect unless zmac is producing ".rel" output.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<H4>Input Control</H4>
<P>
<TT>end</TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Ends the input.  Any lines after an <TT>end</TT> are silently ignored.
If an arg is given, it declares the entry address for the program.
This has no effect in ".cim" output. In ".hex" output
it generates an S-record directing 0 bytes of data to be loaded
at the given address.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<TT>if</TT> ... [ <TT>else</TT> ... ] <TT>endif</TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>For conditional assembly. If you do <TT>if foo</TT> and <TT>foo</TT> evaluates to
zero, all the lines up until the next corresponding <TT>else</TT> or <TT>endif</TT>
are completely ignored.  Conversely, if <TT>foo</TT> evaluates to non-zero, any
lines from a corresponding <TT>else</TT> to the <TT>endif</TT> are ignored.  Ifs can
be nested.  <TT>cond</TT>/<TT>endc</TT> are synonyms for <TT>if</TT>/<TT>endif</TT>.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<TT>include file</TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Include a file. Like C's (well, cpp's) #include and follows the same
include path search rules, but the filename arg
lacks the angle brackets or quotes (though single or double quotes may be used).
<TT>read</TT> is a synonym.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<TT>comment X</TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Suspend assembly until the next occurence of character <TT>X</TT> on a line.
The rest of the line will be ignored.  A multi-line comment.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<TT>assert expr</TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Stop assembly if <TT>expr</TT> is non-zero.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<H4>Cycle Counting</H4>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Set the current opcode fetch count to <TT>expr</TT>.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<H4>Code Generation</H4>
<P>
<TT>8080</TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Make cycle counting operators return 8080 cycle counts and
interpret any ambiguous assembly statements as Intel 8080 mnemonics.
<TT>CP</TT> will be interpreted as "call on positive" and <TT>JP</TT> as "jump on positive".
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<TT>z80</TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Make cycle counting operators return Z-80 cycle counts and
interpret any ambiguous assembly statements as Zilog Z-80 mnemonics.
<TT>CP</TT> will be interpreted as "compare accumulator" and <TT>JP</TT> as "jump unconditionally".
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<TT>jperror enable</TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If <TT>enable</TT> is non-zero, turn on errors when <TT>JR</TT> instructions could be used
instead of <TT>JP</TT>, off otherwise.  Used to check existing code for situations
where shorter code could be generated.  Same as <TT>-J</TT> option.
No effect if in 8080 mode.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<TT>jrpromote enable</TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If <TT>enable</TT> is non-zero, <TT>JR</TT> and <TT>DJNZ</TT> instructions will be promoted to
equivalent <TT>JP</TT> and <TT>DEC&nbsp;B</TT>, <TT>JP&nbsp;NZ</TT> instructions if the relative branch
offset is out of range.  If <TT>enable</TT> is zero, promotion is disabled.
Same as the <TT>-j</TT> option.
No effect if in 8080 mode.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<H4>Undocumented <A NAME="undoc">Instructions</A></H4>
<P>
Most Z-80 chips support a number of undocumented instructions that were part of
the original design but not made an offical part of the Zilog specification.
These instructions may not be supported by all Z-80 chips, especially
licensed variants, but are fairly widely available nonetheless.
<P>
<TT>sl1 r</TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Same as <TT>sla r</TT> but shifts a 1 into the lower bit of <TT>r</TT> rather than a 0.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<TT>in (c)</TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Inputs a byte from port <TT>c</TT> but does not store the value.  Flags are still
set as with the normal <TT>in r,(c)</TT> instruction.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<TT>out (c),0</TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Outputs a zero to port <TT>c</TT>.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<TT>bit/set/res n,(ix+d),r</TT>
<P>
<TT>rlc/rrc/rl/rr/sla/sl1/sra/srl (iy+d),r</TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Same as the corresponding operation on just <TT>(ix+d)</TT> or <TT>(iy+d)</TT> but with
the result being stored both into <TT>(ix+d)</TT> and register <TT>r</TT>.  Except for <TT>bit</TT>
which has no effect on <TT>r</TT>. zmac supports the syntax to allow those
instruction patterns to be generated.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The upper and lower bytes of the <TT>ix</TT> and <TT>iy</TT> can be used in a number of
instructions much in the same way as <TT>d</TT> and <TT>e</TT> correspond to the upper and
lower bytes of <TT>de</TT>.  zmac names these <TT>ixh</TT>, <TT>ixl</TT>, <TT>iyh</TT> and <TT>iyl</TT> and
are referred to generically as <TT>ixylh</TT> here.
<P>
<TT>inc/dec/add/adc/sub/sbc/and/xor/or/cp ixylh</TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Arithmetic or logical operation on <TT>ix</TT> or <TT>iy</TT> high or low byte.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<TT>ld a/b/c/d/e,ixylh</TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Load register with <TT>ix</TT> or <TT>iy</TT> high or low byte.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<TT>ld ixylh,a/b/c/d/e</TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Load <TT>ix</TT> or <TT>iy</TT> high or low byte with register.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<TT>pfix</TT>
<P>
<TT>pfiy</TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Output $DD and $FD prefix bytes.  The Z-80 allows multiple prefix bytes
for IX and IY instructions.  This allows you to specify them abstractly.
There is little purpose except for delaying an interrupt or confusing
disassemblers.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<H4>Miscellaneous</H4>
<P>
<TT>name str</TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Set the name of the output model to <TT>str</TT>.  For compatibility reasons
<TT>str</TT> may be parenthesized (e.g., "<TT>name ('foo')</TT>").  Not all output
formats support an internal name and many have severe length limits.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<TT>rsym</TT> and <TT>wsym</TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Read/write a symbol file. These simply load/save the currently defined
symbols from/to the file specified (in a non-portable format). <TT>rsym</TT>
takes place at the point it is encountered in the file (on the first
pass); <TT>wsym</TT> is delayed until assembly has finished.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<H4>Listing Pseudo-ops</H4>
<P>
There are several pseudo-ops for controlling the listing. None of
these ops appear in the listing themselves:
<P>
<TT>eject</TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Start a new listing page.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<TT>nolist</TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Do nothing. This can be used to have a comment in the source but not
the listing, I suppose.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<TT>elist</TT>, <TT>flist</TT>, <TT>glist</TT>, <TT>mlist</TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>These have the same effect as the similarly-named command-line
options, though possibly with the sense reversed depending on the
default. Use an arg &gt;0 (or no arg) to enable, and an arg &lt;0 to
disable.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<TT>list</TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Sets whether to list or not. You can use this to avoid listing certain
parts of the source. Takes same optional arg as 'elist', etc..
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<TT>title</TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Set title (used in listing and symbol file).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<TT>space</TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Output arg blank lines in the listing, or one line if no arg is given.

Expressions feature a full set of C operators with the same precedence

Here is the complete list of operators, highest-precedence first.
Operators separated only by a space are synonyms; for example, <TT>~</TT>

You can use normal parentheses or square brackets to override
the precedence rules. Square brackets can be used where parentheses would
conflict with Z-80 mnemonic syntax, but this is not necessary in any
practical case.
<P>
The <TT>?</TT> may need spaces around it to distinguish it from a label that
has <TT>?</TT> in it.

<H3>Macros</H3>
The following defines a macro named m with zero or more formal parameters
<TT>p1</TT>, <TT>p2</TT>, ..., <TT>pn</TT>, zero or more local symbols <TT>?s1</TT>, <TT>?s2</TT>, ..., <TT>?sm</TT>,
and body <TT>b1</TT>, <TT>b2</TT>, ...:
<P>
<TABLE>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><PRE><TT>m macro p1, p2, ..., pn, ?s1, ?s2, ..., ?sm</TT> </PRE></TD><TD> </TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><PRE><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b1</TT> </PRE></TD><TD> </TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><PRE><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;endm</TT> </TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
The macro is called by writing:
<BLOCKQUOTE><TT>m v1, v2, ..., vn</TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
A macro call expands to the text of the macro's body, with each 
occurrence of a formal parameter <TT>pk</TT> replaced by the corresponding 
value <TT>vk</TT>, and with each local symbol <TT>?sk</TT> replaced by a new, unique 
symbol invented for this call.  Invented symbols begin with <TT>?</TT>,
so you should avoid using such symbols elsewhere in your program.
<P>
zmac currently does not check that you have provided the right number 
of parameters when calling a macro.  If you provide too few, unmatched 
formals are replaced with the empty string.  If you provide too 
many, the additional values begin to replace local symbols as if 
they were ordinary parameters.  (This could be considered a feature.)  
After the local symbols are all replaced, additional parameters 
are silently ignored.
<P>
For compatibility with Macro-80, the first line of a macro definition can
list other labels that will be treated locally:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;local lab1,lab2,...</TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Each time the macro is expanded the local labels are replaced with unique
names thus avoiding multiple definition problems.
<P>
For compatability with MRAS, macro arguments may be preceeded by <TT>&nbsp;</TT>
in their definition and use.
<P>
Any <TT>`</TT> (backquote) in a macro is ignored thus allowing a macro to
construct identifiers.  For example:
<P>
<TABLE>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><PRE><TT>move macro dir</TT> </PRE></TD><TD> </TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><PRE><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ld`dir`r</TT> </PRE></TD><TD> </TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><PRE><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;endm</TT> </TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
Invoking <TT>move i</TT> will construct a <TT>ldir</TT> block move instruction.
<HR>
<H3>Compatibility</H3>
<P>
zmac is broadly compatible with many original Z-80 and 8080 assemblers
because it accepts many different names for common operations and has
liberal identifier and numeric formats.  It also accepts most simple
usage of macros.
<P>
When assembling old code keep these portability problems in mind.
<P>
Expression order of evaluation may be different.  zmac uses C semantics
more order of evaluation but assemblers often used simple left to right
ordering.  zmac will evaluate <TT>2+2*3</TT> as <TT>8</TT> where other assemblers will
yield <TT>12</TT>.
<P>
zmac has no support operating on strings in macros.  Assemblers like Macro-80
could perform conditional tests on strings.
<P>
Advanced macros are unlikely to work.  zmac hasn't advanced to the state where
all the possible ways of substituting parameters are supported.  Nor does it
have simple repetition, a way to exit a macro expansion early and so on.
<P>
Consult the original assembler manual.  zmac error messages won't help you
figure out what an unknown assembler command is supposed to do.
<P>
Compare against original output.  The very safest thing to do when porting
assembly code is to compare the binary output of zmac against that produced
by the original assembler.  This way you can ensure everything has been
interpreted correctly.  Only once that has been achieved should you modify
the code.
<HR>
<H3>Errors and Warnings</H3>
<P>
Any errors or warnings encountered during assembly are reported to standard
error and in the listing file.  The errors output immediately give the source
file and line number containing the error.  In listings the error letter
and message appear just after the line containing the error.

<H3>Output <A NAME="format">Formats</A></H3>
<P>
Except for ".rel", zmac writes every known output when assembling.  This
is no burden on modern computers and saves having to come up with options
to select a particular output format.
<P>
".rel" is a special case since that format is intended for linking and
can have undefined external symbols which would be errors in the other
formats which do not support them.

Updates and bugfixes over the years by John Providenza, Colin Kelley,
and more recently by Russell Marks, Mark RISON, Chris Smith,
Matthew Phillips and Tim Mann.
<P>
Extensive modifications for cycle counting, multiple output formats,
".rel" output, 8080 mode and older assembler compatibilty were written
by George Phillips.
<P>
This document was based on Russell Marks zmac man page which had
tweaks by Mark RISON and Tim Mann.  George Phillips converted it to HTML
and documented the new features and some older ones (e.g., <TT>phase</TT>/<TT>dephase</TT>).
