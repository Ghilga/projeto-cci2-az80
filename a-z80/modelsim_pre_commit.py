# This script prepares ModelSim *.mpf files for committing to git
#
# Why is this necessary?
#
# ModelSim notoriously shuffles the list of project files that are stored in its
# configuration file (*.mpf) even if no files were added or removed. That results
# in a version system (git, in this case) to always report mpf files as changed
# and needed to be committed even if there has been no _effective_ change to it.
#
# This script sorts the list of project files in a consistent way so no change
# will result in files looking the same way. In addition, the same is done with
# (key value) pairs within each file's line containing properties.
#
# Run this script before committing changes to git and bogus modifications will
# magically dissapear!
